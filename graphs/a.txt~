I would like to start with congratulating u for what u achieved, a begining to a new life, a professional life, as termed by some people.But i believe life will be so easy if we wont get into the complexities of the professionlism.We met a few years ago and to be frank i dont have much idea about your life but somethings are there that i noticed and found them worth sharing with you.Friends are the important part of a human life, we had a great time with you and those will be missed throughout the life.you are going to a place where everything will be a new experience for you new people, new culture etc..There are few things u should keep in mind..The first and the foremost thing is to control your temper because you know, not everyone will be like we are...You are the important part of our lives and we understand you very well...Dont expect anything from anyone because it hurts when someone breaks ur expectations..There are two kinds of people, one who can control themselves after getting hurt and the others who spits it out as an anger..You know which category is suitable for u..:P...so control it...Learn to ignore small things, dont react to them..I dont have much to say ohh!! yes!! be patient, because that will help you in path of your growth..You are an intelligent girl and u will surely achieve what u want to..We all are always with you...Its getting a bit lengthy, right?? okk i will conclude now..Enjoy ur life...Have a great future ahead and will miss u alot...Bye..
